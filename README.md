# The Nature of Species

# Course rationale

We often take the existence of species and their properties for granted. However, recent work on genomics and phenomics are overturning our understanding on what we mean by species, with potentially significant implications for ecology, conservation, and evolution. This seminar will focus largely on understanding "the nature of species". Through readings, discussions, and presentations, we will study what kind of entities species are, explore what genomics, phenomics, and ecology are teaching us about species (e.g., do species correspond to differences in neutral or functional genomic variation? what does this imply about the role of selection, drift, and gene flow for species and speciation? are species in virus the same entity as species in multicellular eukaryotes?), analyze the implications of what species are for ecology, conservation, and macroevolution, as well as examine species in the context of contemporary evolution. Depending on enrollment numbers, students will be expected to lead the presentation of at least one set of readings on a fundamental topic. In addition, depending on the interests of students, we will collaboratively write either a conceptual (review, perspective, opinion) or empirical (meta-analysis) paper for peer-reviewed publication.

# Course format

This is a discussion-based seminar with short presentations and open discussions every week. To this end, all participants are expected to read all papers/readings assigned each week, as well as to bring in depth questions for discussion (at least 4-5). At least 2-3 readings per week will be mandatory and more readings may be suggested. All participants are encouraged to read as many papers as possible from the suggested readings. Each week, one participant will lead the discussion. This person will summarize the main points of each mandatory reading, bring multiple questions (at least 4-5) to foster discussion, and moderate the discussion. The summary of the readings can be a Power Point presentation, but this is not mandatory. Most discussion will focus on the big picture but in some cases we may fous on the technical details or specifics of data analyses. No one, (including the instructor), is an expert in all topics we will cover, so hopefully we will all learn together.

# Learning objectives

In this seminar, students will:

* Gain knowledge about foundational ideas on the evolutionary biology of species 
* Develop the ability to identify and explain key concepts in evolution and ecology, as well as expand on the most significant conclusions presented in the readings
* Develop scientific communication skills
